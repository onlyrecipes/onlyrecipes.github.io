I generally make a massive amount of granola every two weeks and eat it for breakfast daily with soy milk. Ingredients  8 cups oats, not quick cooking oats 1 cup pumpkin seeds 1 cup sunflower seeds 1/2- 3/4 cup brown sugar (sometimes with honey, agave, or maple syrup) 2 Tbsp water 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1/4 tsp nutmeg 1/4 tsp salt 1 tsp vanilla extract 1/4 tsp baking soda  add-ins when out of oven  1 cup raisins or craisns  Instructions   Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Mix oats and nuts together. Leave out dried fruit until after it\u0026rsquo;s out of the oven.\n  In a medium saucepan, combine brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt. Stir frequently until it comes to a boil, and boil for 1 minute.\n  Take off heat, stir in vanilla and baking soda. Whisk until mixture gets foamy. Pour over oats immediately and toss to cover (really just mix real well).\n  Spread oats onto baking sheet (usually I need two for this recipe) with parchment paper underneath.\n  Bake in preheated oven, about 15-30 minutes until lightly golden brown, removing from oven and tossing during baking.\n  Once finished, take out of oven and allow to cool before storing in a container.\n  ","date":1590624000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590624000,"objectID":"51e34623e06e99e8aa8e80712cfad98b","permalink":"/post/crunchy-granola/","publishdate":"2020-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/crunchy-granola/","section":"post","summary":"This is an adapted version of this recipe by Cooking Classy.

I doubled the recipe and made some adjustments to use my own cooked beans. Ingredients  2 cups cooked black beans (rinsed and drained) 1 cup cooked quinoa 1 cup bread crumbs (I used plain gluten free) 4 tablespoons minced onion 1 large clove garlic, minced 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoon hot sauce 1 egg 3 tablespoons canola oil  Directions  (skip if quinoa is already cooked) Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the quinoa is tender and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes. Roughly mash the black beans with a fork leaving some whole black beans in a paste-like mixture. Mix the quinoa, bread crumbs, onion, garlic, cumin, salt, hot sauce, and egg into the black beans using your hands. Form the black bean mixture into patties. If the patties do not form, can try adding more black beans, bread crumbs, or another egg depending on the consistency. Heat the oil in a large skillet. Cook the patties in the hot oil until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side Add siracha mayo sauce and enjoy!
